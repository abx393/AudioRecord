# AudioRecord
This Android app was built to facilitate data collection for a computer science research study on smartphone acoustic sensing for physical exercises. 

This app implements Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW). Essentially, it emits an acoustic tone whose frequency periodically oscillates. While the phone plays the tone, it simultaneously records audio through the microphone, which receives the backscattered sound waves. 

The app provides a user interface that enables subjects of the in-the-wild study to authenticate themselves, to start and stop their data collection, and save their data on a server. This data is then processed and analyzed separately.

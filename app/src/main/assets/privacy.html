<p>Last update: July 11, 2020</p>

<p>Thank you for using our app SonarTest. This privacy policy is effective as of July 11, 2020.</p>

<p>The Ubiquitous Computing Lab (“we” or “us” or “our”), in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, is fully committed to protecting the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the “Application”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.</p>

<h2 id="informationcollected">Information Collected</h2>

<p>We may collect the following information with this application:
Device information: the make, model, and manufacturer of your device, and your operating system version</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Device identifier</strong>: a unique ID for your device to distinguish it from others of the same make and model</li>
<li><strong>Audio Recordings</strong>: microphone recordings captured and saved by the user while using this application</li>
<li><strong>User Inputs</strong>: the values input by the user in the data entry fields of this application</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appprivilegesrequested">App Privileges Requested</h2>

<p>To accomplish this, the app requires access to the following permissions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speaker</strong>: we generate an inaudible sonar frequency using the device’s speaker</li>
<li><strong>Microphone</strong>: we record the sonar echoes using the device’s microphone</li>
<li><strong>External Storage</strong>: we write to your device’s storage to save the audio recordings</li>
<li><strong>Internet Access</strong>: we use the internet to upload your data to our secure server</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="useofinformation">Use of Information</h2>

<p>This application is a research tool and the information from the app is used for research purposes only. We will use the device information, recorded audio, and input values described above to improve our algorithms for performing sonar sensing using commodity smart devices. We may use or share information collected in the app in the follow ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Aggregated data used for internal purposes</em>: We may analyze the data collected to create aggregate/statistical data which we may use to improve our app, prioritize features for enhancement, etc. This is not personal information, and cannot be used to identify you or other users.</li>
<li><em>Aggregated data provided to our funders, industry partners and collaborators</em>: We may analyze the data collected to create aggregate/statistical data which we may share with our funders, industry partners and collaborators. This is not personal information, and cannot be used to identify you or other users.</li>
<li><em>Aggregated data used in scientific research and published in reports and papers</em>: We may analyze the data collected to create aggregate/statistical data which may be used in scientific research studies and reports and publications from those studies. This is not personal information, and cannot be used to identify you or other users.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informationsecurity">Information Security</h2>

<p>We store your recorded data on a secure server with access limited to the experimenters. Your recordings will be assigned an anonymous identifier. A mapping between identifiers and contact information will be maintained separately and securely.</p>

<p>Any individual permitted to perform annotation will sign a confidentiality agreement. Annotation will include labelling the audio recordings with a description of each portion of the audio, including labeling the occurrence of physical activities.</p>

<p>Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.</p>

<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

<li>To protect against legal liability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informationdeletionandretention">Information Deletion and Retention</h2>

<p>If you ask us to destroy all or part of your audio recordings at any time, we will do so immediately. To withdraw your recordings, please contact the study team or use the contact information below. We will retain anonymous data for as long as necessary for internal purposes and conduct of scientific research. We may retain the information indefinitely.</p>

<h2 id="nothird-partytrackers">No Third-Party Trackers</h2>

<p>This application does not use cookies or web beacons. We do not use third-party software to serve ads, perform web analytics, or track the users behavior outside of the application.</p>
